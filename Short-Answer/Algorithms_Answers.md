#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The function iterates through n once, therefore  O(n).


b) The running time is O(n^2) because we have two nested loops.


c) An algorithm has ‘constant time’ when the number of operations doesn’t change as the number of elements increase. In the bunnyEars example, it doesn’t matter how many elements are contained in bunnies. However, the function is being called recursively n times before reaching base case so its O(n)
